# Solar Age Calculator

#### Independent Project for Epicodus, 11/8/2021

#### By Lucian Miller

## Description

Ever wonder what age you would be on other planets in our solar system? This application will tell you your ages on Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter! It will also inform you how long you have left to live on those planets when compared to the average life expectancy, and if you've lived past the life expectancy, how many years on each planet you've lived past it! 
This program was created to test the knowledge I have gathered in this section of class.
